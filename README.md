## Some notes
  - The app uses doesn't consume the RedditAPI (since it uses OAuth which is a little bit more complex to implement). Instead it consumes DummyAPI which provides static content that can be used for this purpose.
  - Some more tests should be added to have good coverage.
  - Image container in Post Details has some style issues that need to be fixed in the future.
